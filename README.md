# Spotify Clone PHP

Course for making Spotify clone in: php, js, css, html

## Set Up Local Server

[XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)

- Make sure SQL Server and Apache are running

## Another Approach Local Server

Eh, on second thought, not great if you are using MySQL through XAMPP

**VS Code Add-ins**

1. PHP Extension Pack
1. PHP Server (instead of XAMPP)

# TODO:

1. Refactoring
   - Create sub php files for shared components
1. Progress green hover needs work, maybe up an element
   - Also needs to work when mouse down, sliding
1. Left Nav
   - Your music now, eventually albums and artists
   - Your music is just playlists
   - Will need to add tables for albums and artists
1. Artist page
   - Artist header image (need to update database)
1. Small one. when clicking the song on now playing
   - Already opens to album page
   - Do a highlight effect on selected song (css style)
1. Add Playlist pop up instead of alert
1. Full Screen
1. Search page, something more interesting for artist
   - Inspiration from spotify
1. Something more clever on playlist pic
1. Profile page more like spotify
   - Just take a look at that and try to implement (lot of work)
1. Look at PDO replacement for mysql
