# Spotify Clone PHP

Course for making Spotify clone in: php, js, css, html

## Set Up Local Server

[XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)

- Make sure SQL Server and Apache are running

## Another Approach Local Server

Eh, on second thought, not great if you are using MySQL through XAMPP

**VS Code Add-ins**

1. PHP Extension Pack
1. PHP Server (instead of XAMPP)

# TODO:

1. Refactoring
   - Remove jquery
1. Progress green hover needs work, maybe up an element
   - Also needs to work when mouse down, sliding
1. Left Nav
   - Your music now, eventually albums and artists
1. Scroll needs to be contextual
   - Right now, it scrolls the main container
   - I eventually want the scroll on volume to turn it up/down
1. Full Screen
1. Home Page (index) is just browse page
   - Could do more, but I would need more content for it to look interesting
