Course for making Spotify clone in: php, js, css, html

## Set Up Local Server

[XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)

- Make sure SQL Server and Apache are running

## Another Approach Local Server

**VS Code Add-ins**

1. PHP Extension Pack
1. PHP Server (instead of XAMPP)
1. Local Install of MySQL
   - [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)

# TODO:

1. Spotify API
   - [Link](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/)
1. PHP Files - variable extraction
1. MVC Refactor with Laravel
   - [Link](https://laravel.com/)
1. Get gifs in my readme to show app functionality
1. Progress green hover needs work, maybe up an element
   - Also needs to work when mouse down, sliding
1. Small one. when clicking the song on now playing
   - Already opens to album page
   - Do a highlight effect on selected song (css style)
1. Add Playlist pop up instead of alert
1. Full Screen
1. Search page, something more interesting for artist
   - Inspiration from spotify
1. Something more clever on playlist pic
1. Profile page more like spotify
   - Just take a look at that and try to implement (lot of work)
1. Look at PDO replacement for mysql
